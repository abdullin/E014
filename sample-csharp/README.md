## Being the Worst

This folder contains additional materials for **Episode 14**:

* Episode 14 Notes:
* CSharp sample project covering Application Services, Domain Services, DSL code-generation, and Specficiations/Unit Tests
* See "Visual Studio Settings" section on how to setup .ddd files:[ http://lokad.github.com/lokad-codedsl/](http://lokad.github.com/lokad-codedsl/)
* To execute a version of the Lokad-codedsl utility included in the sample, please launch the dsl.cmd inside of E014-now-serving-dsl\sample-csharp\dsl.cmd
* If you keep this DSL console utility running in the background it will automatically re-generate C# code in Messages.cs when you make changes and save the Messages.ddd file inside of the "Contracts" folder of the project.


BTW Episode Draft
=================

This is technical draft for the final version of factory sample within Beingtheworst.com podcast.

Technically code here matches to what we use in Lokad for production purposes (at the moment of writing), however the domain is far from being perfect.

How to run it?
--------------

There are two options:

* You can open the solution and run Domain.Tests as console application (it will print specifications to text output)


* Open the solution in Visual Studio and run unit tests (e.g. with NUnit runner or ReSharper built-in test runner). Watch what is printed to output of each test

How to understand it?
