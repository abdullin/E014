BTW Episode Draft
=================

This is technical draft for the final version of factory sample within Beingtheworst.com podcast.

Technically code here matches to what we use in Lokad for production purposes (at the moment of writing), however the domain is far from being perfect.

How to run it?
--------------

There are two options:

* You can open the solution and run Domain.Tests as console application (it will print specifications to text output)


* Open the solution in Visual Studio and run unit tests (e.g. with NUnit runner or ReSharper built-in test runner). Watch what is printed to output of each test

How to understand it?
